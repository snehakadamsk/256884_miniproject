INTRODUCTION:
Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.

Reasearch:
OBJECTIVE:
To encrypt and decrypt the text with symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic methods.

BENEFITS:
The data is securely sent over the channel without being able to read easily by any third person.

COST AND FEATURES:
Cost of encryption at the sender side and that of decryption at the receiver side is minimal.

Features include information security and safe transmission of data.

Definition of the System:
The System takes the text to be encrypted as the input and the required key and encrypts the data according to the algorithm as selected.
At the receiver end, the data is decrypted with cipher text as the input.
The system generates key in certain techniques.
